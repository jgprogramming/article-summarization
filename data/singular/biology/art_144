[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56293182","text":"Self-decoration\n\nSelf-decoration is a method of camouflage in which an animal covers itself with materials, sometimes living, from the environment. It is found in decorator crabs, some insects such as caddis flies and the masked hunter bug, and occasionally also in octopuses. In military camouflage it is seen in the use of ghillie suits by snipers and the helmet nets of soldiers more generally, when these are camouflaged by inserting grass and other local plant materials, and in a more general way by the use of decorated camouflage netting over vehicles, gun emplacements and observation posts.\n\nIn 1889, William Bateson observed in detail the way that decorator crabs fix materials on their backs. He noted that \"[t]he whole proceeding is most human and purposeful\", and that if a \"Stenorhynchus\" crab is cleaned, it will \"\"immediately\" begin to clothe itself again with the same care and precision as before\".\n\nIn his book \"The Colours of Animals\" (1890), Edward Bagnall Poulton classified protective animal coloration into types such as warning colours and protective mimicry. He included self decoration under the heading \"Adventitious Protection\", quoting Bateson's account of decorator crabs.\n\nIn his textbook \"Adaptive Coloration in Animals\" (1940), Hugh Bamford Cott describes self-decoration under the heading \"adventitious concealing coloration\", also naming it \"adventitious resemblance\". He describes it as a device \"perhaps unrivalled\" for effective concealment, and points out that it is brought about and depends on \"highly specialized behaviour\". Further, it grades into other means of protection including \"the borrowing of protection from aposematic partners\" and the use of \"fortified hiding-places\" and burrows. Cott compares the way Australian aborigines once used water lily leaves over their faces to swim up to waterfowl until they could catch them by the legs.\n\nDecorator crabs of many species pick up pieces of seaweed, shells, small stones, and living organisms such as hydrozoa, sponges, and sea anemones, sticking these to their shells, which are provided with curved hairs to hold the decorations, as semi-permanent camouflage, keeping them until they next moult. The relationship with some of these animals, such as sea anemones is mutualistic; in the case of aposematic animals like stinging sea anemones, the crabs are making use of the warning coloration of these partners to ward off predators.\n\nSelf-decoration is seen in some insects such as caddis flies, the nymphs of the masked hunter bug, and occasionally also in octopuses.\n\nThe ghillie suit was developed by Scottish gamekeepers for hunting deer, and adapted initially by a Scottish Highland regiment, the Lovat Scouts, for military use. In 1916, the Lovat Scouts became the British Army's first sniper unit. Snipers of many armies have since then adopted the ghillie suit for the effective concealment that it affords. Ghillie suits are fitted with many loops into which the wearer can insert grass or other plant materials to match the local environment, or are made with cloth simulating tufts of leaves. Such good camouflage comes at the price of the weight of the ghillie suit and the attached materials; the suit is hot and uncomfortable to wear in hot weather, and it restricts mobility.\n\nCott used the example of the larva of the blotched emerald moth, which fixes a screen of fragments of leaves to its specially hooked bristles, to argue that military camouflage had used the same method, pointing out that the \"device is ... essentially the same as one widely practised during the Great War for the concealment, not of caterpillars, but of caterpillar-tractors, [gun] battery positions, observation posts and so forth.\"\n","id":"56293182","title":"Self-decoration"}]
