The study was supported by the National Museum of Natural History. The museum was created only 30 years later at the site by the National Museum of Natural History, artists and those associated with the excavations at Dorkovo to display the fossils, a gomphothere model and other animal sculptures, and a diorama based on the Pliocene animals and forest. Funding for the museum was provided under the regional development of the European Union (EU).\n\nThe museum was inaugurated on 19 September 2013 by Rosen Plevneliev, President of Bulgaria. It is located from Sofia in the Rhodopi (village) of Dorkovo between Velingrad and the Batak Reservoir, in the Pazardzhik region.\n\nThe museum, set amidst the forest, showcases of some of the fossil findings of the excavations, which revealed mostly gomphotheres (extinct elephant relatives). It is housed in a domed structure made of wood both on the inner and outer surfaces, which measures . Apart from the fossils collected from the field, the major attraction in the museum is model of a gomphothere of the species of \"Anancus arvernensis\", which was made by the Simeon Stoilov Studio. It measures in height. The diorama on the interior wooden walls of the museum measures and was painted there by Velizar, the \"painter-animalist\" of the Field Museum, Chicago, and shows examples not only of proboscids but also monkeys, \"Hipparion\" horses and forests.\n","id":"50294874","title":"Dorkovo Museum"}]
