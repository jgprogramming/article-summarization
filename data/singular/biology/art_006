The equation uses a covariance between a trait and fitness to give a mathematical description of evolution and natural selection. It provides a way to understand the effects that gene transmission and natural selection have on the proportion of genes within each new generation of a population. The Price equation was derived by George R. Price, working in London to re-derive W.D. Hamilton's work on kin selection. The Price equation also has applications in economics. Examples of the Price equation can be found here: Price equation examples.\n\nThe Price equation shows that a change in the average amount \"z\" of a trait in a population from one generation to the next (\"Δz\") is determined by the covariance between the amounts \"z\" of the trait for subpopulations \"i\" and the fitnesses \"w\" of the subpopulations, together with the expected change in the amount of the trait value due to fitness, namely \"E(w Δz)\": \nHere \"w\" is the average fitness over the population, and E and cov represent the population mean and covariance respectively.\n\nThe covariance term captures the effects of natural selection; if the covariance between fitness (\"w\") and the trait value (\"z\") is positive then the trait value is predicted to increase on average over population i. If the covariance is negative then the trait is deleterious and is predicted to decrease in frequency.\n\nThe second term (\"E(w Δz)\") represents factors other than direct selection that can affect trait evolution. This term can encompass genetic drift, mutation bias, or meiotic drive. Additionally, this term can encompass the effects of multi-level selection or group selection.\n\nPrice (1972) referred to this as the \"environment change\" term, and denoted both terms using partial derivative notation (∂ and ∂). This concept of environment includes interspecies and ecological effects. Price describes this as follows:\n\nSuppose there is a population of formula_2 individuals over which the amount of a particular characteristic varies. Those formula_2 individuals can be grouped by the amount of the characteristic that each displays. There can be as few as just one group of all formula_2 individuals (consisting of a single shared value of the characteristic) and as many as formula_2 groups of one individual each (consisting of formula_2 distinct values of the characteristic). Index each group with formula_7 so that the number of members in the group is formula_8 and the value of the characteristic shared among all members of the group is formula_9. Now assume that having formula_9 of the characteristic is associated with having a fitness formula_11 where the product formula_12 represents the number of offspring in the next generation. Denote this number of offspring from group formula_7 by formula_14 so that formula_15. Let formula_16 be the average amount of the characteristic displayed by the offspring from group formula_7. Denote the amount of change in characteristic in group formula_7 by formula_19 defined by\n\nNow take formula_21 to be the average characteristic value in this population and formula_22 to be the average characteristic value in the next generation. Define the change in average characteristic by formula_23. That is,\n\nNote that this is \"not\" the average value of formula_25 (as it is possible that formula_26). Also take formula_27 to be the average fitness of this population. The Price equation states:\n\nwhere the functions formula_29 and formula_30 are respectively defined in Equations (1) and (2) below and are equivalent to the traditional definitions of sample mean and covariance; however, they are not meant to be statistical estimates of characteristics of a population. In particular, the Price equation is a deterministic difference equation that models the trajectory of the actual mean value of a characteristic along the flow of an actual population of individuals. Assuming that the mean fitness formula_27 is not zero, it is often useful to write it as\n\nIn the specific case that characteristic formula_33 (i.e., fitness itself is the characteristic of interest), then Price's equation reformulates Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection.\n\nTo prove the Price equation, the following definitions are needed. If formula_8 is the number of occurrences of a pair of real numbers formula_35 and formula_36, then:\n\n\n\nThe notation formula_40 will also be used when\nconvenient.\n\nSuppose there is a population of organisms all of which have a genetic characteristic described by some real number. For example, high values of the number represent an increased visual acuity over some other organism with a lower value of the characteristic. Groups can be defined in the population which are characterized by having the same value of the characteristic. Let subscript formula_7 identify the group with characteristic formula_9 and let formula_8 be the number of organisms in that group. The total number of organisms is then formula_2 where:\n\nThe average value of the characteristic formula_21 is defined as:\n\nNow suppose that the population reproduces and the number of individuals in group formula_7 in the next generation is represented by formula_48. The so-called fitness formula_11 of group formula_7 is defined to be the ratio of the number of its individuals in the next generation to the number of its individuals in the previous generation. That is,\n\nThus, saying that a group has \"higher fitness\" is equivalent to saying that its members produce more offspring per individual in the next generation. Similarly, formula_51 represents the total number of individuals across all groups, which can be expressed as:\n\nFurthermore, the average fitness of the population can be shown to be the growth rate of the population as a whole, as in:\n\nAlthough the total population may grow, the proportion of individuals from a certain group may change. In particular, if one group has a higher fitness than another group, then the higher-fitness group will have a larger increase in representation in the next generation than the lower-fitness group. The average fitness represents how the population grows, and those groups with below-average fitness will tend to decline in numbers while those groups with above-average fitness will tend to increase in numbers.\n\nAlong with the proportion of individuals in each group changing over time, the trait values within a single group may vary slightly from one generation to another (e.g., due to mutation). These two pressures together will cause the average value of the characteristic over the whole population to change over time. In the new generation, the average value formula_22 of the characteristic is:\n\nwhere \"z\"′ are the (possibly new) values of the characteristic in group \"i\". Equation (2) shows that:\n\nCall the change in characteristic value from parent to child populations formula_19 so that formula_55. As seen in Equation (1), the expected value operator formula_29 is linear, so\n\nCombining Equations (7) and (8) leads to\n\nNow, let's compute the first term in the equality above. From Equation (1), we know that:\n\nSubstituting the definition of fitness, formula_58 (Equation (4)), we get:\n\nNext, substituting the definitions of average fitness (formula_59) from Equation (5), and average child characteristics (formula_60) from Equation (6) gives the Price Equation:\n\nWhen the characteristic values \"z\" do not change from the parent to the child generation, the second term in the Price equation becomes zero resulting in a simplified version of the Price equation:\n\nwhich can be restated as:\n\nwhere \"v\" is the fractional fitness: \"v\"= \"w\"/\"w\".\n\nThis simple Price equation can be proven using the definition in Equation (2) above. It makes this fundamental statement about evolution: \"If a certain inheritable characteristic is correlated with an increase in fractional fitness, the average value of that characteristic in the child population will be increased over that in the parent population.\"\n\nThe Price equation can describe any system that changes over time but is most often applied in evolutionary biology. The provides an example of simple directional selection. The shows how a [heterozygote] advantage can affect trait evolution. The Price equation can also be applied to population context dependent traits such as the evolution of . Additionally, the Price equation is flexible enough to model second order traits such as the . The Price equation also provides an extension to Founder effect which shows change in population traits in different settlements\n\nSometimes the genetic model being used encodes enough information into the parameters used by the Price equation to allow the calculation of the parameters for all subsequent generations. This property is referred to as dynamical sufficiency. For simplicity, the following looks at dynamical sufficiency for the simple Price equation, but is also valid for the full Price equation.\n\nReferring to the definition in Equation (2), the simple Price equation for the character \"z\" can be written:\n\nFor the second generation:\n\nThe simple Price equation for \"z\" only gives us the value of \"z\" '  for the first generation, but does not give us the value of \"w\" '  and 〈\"w\" ' \"z\" ' 〉 which are needed to calculate \"z\"″ for the second generation. The variables \"w\" '  and 〈\"w\" ' \"z\" ' 〉 can both be thought of as characteristics of the first generation, so the Price equation can be used to calculate them as well:\n\nThe five 0-generation variables \"w\", \"z\", 〈\"w\"  \"z\" 〉, 〈\"w\" 〉, and 〈\"w\" \"z\" 〉 which must be known before proceeding to calculate the three first generation variables \"w\" ', \"z\" ', and 〈\"w\" ' \"z\" ' 〉, which are needed to calculate \"z\"″ for the second generation. It can be seen that in general the Price equation cannot be used to propagate forward in time unless there is a way of calculating the higher moments (〈\"w\" 〉 and 〈\"w\" \"z\" 〉) from the lower moments in a way that is independent of the generation. Dynamical sufficiency means that such equations can be found in the genetic model, allowing the Price equation to be used alone as a propagator of the dynamics of the model forward in time.\n\nThe simple Price equation was based on the assumption that the characters \"z\" do not change over one generation. If it is assumed that they do change, with \"z\" being the value of the character in the child population, then the full Price equation must be used. A change in character can come about in a number of ways. The following two examples illustrate two such possibilities, each of which introduces new insight into the Price equation.\n\nWe focus on the idea of the fitness of the genotype. The index \"i\" indicates the genotype and the number of type \"i\" genotypes in the child population is:\n\nwhich gives fitness:\n\nSince the individual mutability \"z\" does not change, the average mutabilities will be:\n\nwith these definitions, the simple Price equation now applies.\n\nIn this case we want to look at the idea that fitness is measured by the number of children an organism has, regardless of their genotype. Note that we now have two methods of grouping, by lineage, and by genotype. It is this complication that will introduce the need for the full Price equation. The number of children an \"i\"-type organism has is:\n\nwhich gives fitness:\n\nWe now have characters in the child population which are the average character of the \"i\"-th parent.\n\nwith global characters:\n\nwith these definitions, the full Price equation now applies.\n\nThe use of the change in average characteristic (z'-z) per generation as a measure of evolutionary progress is not always appropriate. There may be cases where the average remains unchanged (and the covariance between fitness and characteristic is zero) while evolution is nevertheless in progress.\n\nA critical discussion of the use of the Price equation can be found in van Veelen (2005) \"On the use of the Price equation\" and van Veelen et al. (2012) \"Group selection and inclusive fitness are not equivalent; the Price equation vs. models and statistics\". A discussion of this criticism can be found in Frank (2012) \n\nPrice's equation features in the plot and title of the 2008 thriller film \"WΔZ\".\n\nThe Price equation also features in posters in the computer game \"BioShock 2\", in which a consumer of a \"Brain Boost\" tonic is seen deriving the Price equation while simultaneously reading a book. The game is set in the 1950s, substantially before Price's work.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"1076205","title":"Price equation"}]
