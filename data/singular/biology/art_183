[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35632441","text":"Collodictyon\n\nCollodictyon is a basal genus of single-celled eukaryotes not closely related to any heretofore known kingdom of that domain.\n\nThree species are currently recognised in this genus. The type species is \"Collodictyon triciliatum\". A second species—\"Collodictyon sparsevacuolatum\"—named by Skuja is also recognised; this species is found in freshwater in the United States and Europe. A third species \"Collodictyon sphaericum\" has been described but its description is in doubt. A fourth species—\"Collodictyon hongkongense\"—has been described by Skvortzow but this description is considered inadequate and this species is regarded as being of dubious validity.\n\nAlong with the genus \"Diphylleia\", this organism appears to be only distantly related to the other eukaryotes. They share some morphological features with the species currently placed within the Excavata. However this latter clade is considered to be polyphyletic and in need of resolution (reorganisation into different groups). For this reason inclusion of this genus within the excavates may not assist in understanding its phylogenetic position.\n\nBrugerolle has proposed a family, \"Collodictyonidae\" for this genus and \"Diphylleia\".\n\nAnother genus that is related to \"Collodictyon\" is \"Sulcomonas.\n\nScientists speculate that further study of \"Collodictyon\" may yield insights into the prehistoric beginnings of life hundreds of millions of years ago. Scientists from Norway have been studying a particular type of \"Collodictyon\" found living in sludge in Årungen, a lake in the municipality of Ås in Norway. Kamran Shalchian-Tabrizi, the leader of the Microbial Evolution Research Group (MERG), has claimed that these organisms resemble the basal eukaryote.\n\nCollodictyon now appears to have emerged in Varisulca.\n\nThe species in this genus range in size from 30 to 50 µm in length, can grow broad pseudopodia, and have four flagella and a ventral feeding groove or sulcus. They are devoid of cellulosic cell walls, chloroplasts or stigmata. There are two to several contractile vacuoles.\n\nThe cell shape is variable but is mostly obovoid to ellipsoid. The lateral cell margins maybe somewhat angular leading to a broad, truncated rounded apex. This posterior margin narrows posteriorly and either bears 1-3 lobes or is simply broadly rounded. This margin is often pseudopodial.\n\nThe nucleus typically lies in the posterior half of the cell.\n\nThe mitochondria have tubular cristae.\n\nOrganelles called dictyosomes are present and arranged in a horseshoe like shape.\n\nMembers of this genus are known to reproduce asexually through cell division. Whether sexual reproduction occurs is currently unknown.\n\"Collodictyon triciliatum\" has four flagella connected to basal bodies, generally of equal length, as long as or slightly longer than the body of Collodictyon. Number one flagellum is connected to a dorsal root, while number two flagellum is connected to a ventral root. Number three and four flagella are on either side of these two and have dorsal roots.\n\nOriginally \"Collodictyon triciliatum\" was described from the island of Bombay and later in central Europe. In Europe this species is found from Spain to Norway. \"Collodictyon\" has also been reported in North America.\n\nThe feeding habits of this organism have rarely been studied.\n\nDag Klaveness reported that the creatures are \"not sociable\" and will cannibalize each other when food is scarce. \"Collodictyon\" will ingest freshwater algae and appears to be unable to survive on a diet of bacteria alone. Curiously the algae remain viable at least for a while after being engulfed. It is possible that the algae are \"enslaved\".\n\n\"Collodictyon triciliatum\" was originally named by H. J. Carter in 1865.\nCarter's original species description is as follows:\n\nIn 1917, it was classified as being one of the \"simplest and most primitive\" type of \"Polymastigina\".\n\n","id":"35632441","title":"Collodictyon"}]
