The gene has been found in at least five species of bacteria: \"Escherichia coli\", \"Salmonella enterica\", \"Klebsiella pneumonia\", \"Enterobacter aerogenes\", and \"Enterobacter cloacae\". It has been experimentally transferred in the lab from E. coli to \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\".\n\nThe mechanism of resistance of the MCR gene is a phosphatidylethanolamine transferase. The enzyme transfers a phosphoethanolamine residue to the lipid A present in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria. The altered lipid A has much lower affinity for colistin and related polymyxins resulting in reduced activity of the antimicrobial. This type of resistance is known as target modification.\n\nThe gene was first discovered in \"E. coli\" (strain SHP45) from a pig in China April 2011 and published in November 2015. \nIt was identified by independent researchers in human samples from Malaysia, China, England, Scotland, and the United States.\n\nIn April 2016, a 49-year-old woman sought medical care at a Pennsylvania clinic for UTI symptoms. PCR of an \"E. coli\" isolate cultured from her urine revealed the \"mcr-1\" gene for the first time in the United States, and the CDC sent an alert to health care facilities. In the following twelve months, four additional people were reported to have infections with mcr-1 carrying bacteria.\n\n","id":"48848503","title":"MCR-1"}]
