[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53750001","text":"Evolutionary Theory (journal)\n\nLeigh Van Valen was an evolutionary biologist that was notable for writing a multitude of scientific papers – roughly 300 over the course of his lifetime. Some of his most important theories included the Red Queen hypothesis which had been rejected by many respectable journals of the time. Van Valen began and published the peer reviewed journal : \"Evolutionary theory\" with its first issue in July 1973.\n\nThe very first article in \"Evolutionary Theory\" was written by Van Valen and titled “A New Evolutionary Law” – notably his most famous paper where he states his Red Queen Hypothesis. He also introduced what would become known as Van Valen’s law in this very same paper. The original name – law of constant extinction – states that “the probability of extinction for species and larger evolutionary groups bears no relation to how long it may have already existed”. He also contended that “The fossil record shows that lineages become neither more extinction-resistant nor more vulnerable over time”. \nOne of the journals that originally rejected Van Valen’s article, Nature (journal) , recognized the importance of his work by confirming his work with several follow-up studies.\n\"Evolutionary Theory\" is copyrighted by the University of Chicago where Van Valen managed the journal.\n\nOver the course of the journal 325 publications were made with 64 of those belonging to Van Valen.\n\n\"Evolutionary theory\" aimed for low cost and fast publication, compared to most journals where from start to finish publishing could be a very lengthy process. The journal branded itself as an “international journal of fact and interpretation”. The title cover also states that it is dedicated to the primacy of content over display, which also had a part in the low cost and rapid publication.\n\nThe journal itself in some ways was atypical as it allowed purely description papers, but reserved the right to reject more routine theoretical work. While there is no page minimum or maximum, \"Evolutionary Theory\" shied away from excessive wordiness, and in general was very welcoming to unconventional papers. Van Valen aimed to move away from discriminatory restrictions on page lengths, along with the fact that many journals had mandatory page charges, thus one of many reasons for long publication times during that era. \"Evolutionary Theory\" did not have a mandatory charge but maintained that a voluntary charge of $12.00 per page would be of assistance. The journal even went to state that the charge “cannot be expected of those without institutional or grant funds “, however partial charges were accepted. Each volume contained roughly 300 to 400 pages in total.\n\"Evolutionary theory\" is “not a substitute for others”. Thus, further solidifying that it was one of the more unconventional journals of its time. Van Valen even went so far as to state that the more “acceptable\" a work is the less original it is- most certainly a quip at other major journals of the time.\n\n\"Evolutionary theory\" covered a wide variety of topics within evolution and biology.\n\n\"The evolutionary half of biology: that part of biology where the center of interest is on organisms and populations, i.e., on the phenotype and its various interrelations rather than on molecules and cells for their own sake. This includes, but is not restricted to, ecology, paleontology, population genetics, plant and animal systematics, molecular evolution, comparative physiology and behavior, anatomy, biological philosophy and history (at the professional level, not meanderings), comparative cytology, anthropology, developmental patterns, and biogeography\".\n\nIn addition to traditional publications, speculations and critical discussion of book, papers or ideas were strongly welcomed. Papers that disagree with the editor’s view were also more likely to be published than those that agreed. Another item that promoted the rapid spread of ideas was that the journal would also publish abstracts of unpublished papers that had not yet been rejected.\n\nAll articles were published in English, however for articles that were not originally in English, a copy of the abstract in the native language could remain.\n\nFirst volume published: July 1973-December 1976\n\nFinal volume published: October 1999- to October 2003 \nMost volumes spanned roughly three years, however after volume nine the length varied from as little as one year-up until five.\n\nEditors:\n\n-Leigh Van Valen, Department of Ecology & Evolution, University of Chicago\n\n-Melissa Stoller, Department of Ecology & Evolution, University of Chicago\n\nManaging Editors:\n\n-Virginia C. Maiorana, Department of Ecology & Evolution, University of Chicago\n\nIn addition to the founding and creating of the journal, Van Valen also served as its editor up until its final publication in 2003.\nThe editorial board consisted of several notable individuals as well as several major institutions from all over the world, the number of individuals/ institutions listed varied from as much as 66 to 78 members over the course of the journal.\n\n\"Evolutionary Theory\" stressed low cost publication which can be reflected in its pricing. In 1973 – on the first issue the price for the individual journal was $4.00. Subscriptions were also offered and varied in price depending on several factors. The price for institutions in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa were priced at $6.00, everywhere else was listed as $15.00. Individual subscriptions were offered at a rate of $10.00, or $6.00 if the individual had an income of less than $10,000.\n\nPrices in the final issue of the journal were as followed: per year for institutions in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa were priced at $9.00, where everywhere else was $29.00. Individual subscriptions were $26.00, and those with an income under $15000 could have a subscription for a rate of $16.00 per year.\n\nThe journal also was non-profit which caused small fluctuations in the price.\n\n\"Evolutionary Theory\" was previously available online, however as of March 2017 is no longer on Van Valen's website.\n\n","id":"53750001","title":"Evolutionary Theory (journal)"}]
