[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47906524","text":"GADV-protein world hypothesis\n\nGADV-protein world is a hypothetical stage of abiogenesis. GADV stands for the 1-letter codes of four amino acids, namely, glycine (G), alanine (A), aspartic acid (D) and valine (V), the main components of GADV proteins. In the GADV-protein world hypothesis, it is argued that the prebiotic chemistry before the emergence of genes involved a stage where GADV-proteins were able to pseudo-replicate. This hypothesis is contrary to RNA world hypothesis, which is the most accepted theory of abiogenesis.\n\nThe GADV-protein world hypothesis was first proposed by Kenji Ikehara at Nara Women's University. It is supported by GNC-SNS primitive gene code hypothesis (GNC hypothesis) also formulated by him. In the GNC hypothesis, the origin of the present standard genetic code is considered to be the GNC genetic code that includes the codons GGC, GCC, GAC, GUC, respectively coding glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and valine; it also follows the SNS primitive genetic code that codes 10 amino acids where N denotes arbitrary four RNA bases and S denotes guanine (G) and cytosine (C).\n\nThe GADV hypothesis proposes these mechanisms:\n\n\n","id":"47906524","title":"GADV-protein world hypothesis"}]
