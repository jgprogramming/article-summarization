[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2386275","text":"Buddhism and evolution\n\nEvolution is not explicitly mentioned in the Tipitaka. As no major principles of Buddhism contradict it, many Buddhists tacitly accept the theory of evolution. Questions about the eternity or infinity of the universe at large are counted among the 14 unanswerable questions which the Buddha maintained were counterproductive areas of speculation. As such, many Buddhists do not think about these kinds of questions as meaningful for the Buddhist goal of relieving oneself and others from suffering. One does not need to know the origin of life in order to achieve enlightenment.\n\nDalai Lama dismisses the element of randomness in the theory of evolution based on natural selection:\n\nLopez elaborates that the process of Rebirth (into any of a large number of states of being including the human, any kind of animal and several types of supernatural being) is conditioned by karma (action of consciousness), which explains Dalai Lama's view.\n\nBuddhists believe the beginning of this world and of life is inconceivable since they have neither beginning nor end. Buddhists believe that the world was not created once upon a time, but that the world has been created millions of times every second and will continue to do so by itself and will break away by itself. \n\nAnagarika Dharmapala once stated that \"the theory of evolution was one of the ancient teachings of the Buddha.\"\n\nIn the Majjhima Nikaya, a potential follower asks the Buddha for an answer to the problem of cosmogony:\n\nThis Parable of the arrow has often been used to illustrate the Buddha's teachings that \"practitioners who concern themselves with the origins of the universe and other topics are missing the point of religious practice.\"\n\nAlbert Low, a Zen master and author of \"The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution\", (2008) opposes neo-Darwinism and the selfish gene theory as he claims they are materialistic. He also opposes creationism for being dogmatic and instead advocates spiritual evolution.\n\nStephen T. Asma has noted that the Buddha himself largely avoided answering questions about the origins of the universe.\n\nThe Buddha argued that there is no apparent rational necessity for the existence of a creator god because everything ultimately is created by mind. Belief in a creator is not necessarily addressed by a religion based on phenomenology, and Buddhism is generally accepting of modern scientific theories about the formation of the universe. This can be argued either from the standpoint that it simply does not matter, or from an interpretation of the Aga単単a Sutta favoring the notion that it describes the basic concept of evolution.\n\nIn the Agga単単a Sutta, found in the Pali Canon, the Buddha does appear to give a highly detailed answer to this issue. The Buddha, speaking to the monk Vasettha, a former Brahmin, states the following:\n\nBecause the Buddha seems to present a model of cosmology wherein the universe expands and contracts over extremely long periods of time, this description has been found by some to be consistent with the expanding universe model and Big Bang.\n\nAccording to the Agganna sutta, animals must have been present before humans completed their \"devolution\"; moreoever, the asexual proto-humans had apparently domesticated the cow and lived in towns and villages.\n\nThe concept of spiritual evolution has been taught in Buddhism. William Sturgis Bigelow, a physician and Buddhist, attempted to merge biology with spirituality; he accepted the existence of both material and spiritual realms. Many of his ideas were discussed in his book \"Buddhism and Immortality\" (1908). Bigelow used the concept of natural selection as a mechanism for evolution. According to Bigelow spiritual evolution is when an individual emerges from \"unconditioned consciousness\" and \"moves up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection\". Next the individual moves to a level of celestial experience, and finally is able to \"return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge.\" Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution; he believed Buddhism and science were compatible.\n\n","id":"2386275","title":"Buddhism and evolution"}]
