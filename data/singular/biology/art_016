[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2681589","text":"Noogenesis\n\nNoogenesis (Ancient Greek: \"νοῦς\"=mind + \"γένεσις\" = origin, becoming) is the emergence and evolution of intelligence.\n\nNoo, nous (British: , US: ) – from the ancient Greek , has synonyms in other languages (Chinese), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: mind, intelligence, intellect, reason; wisdom; insight, intuition, thought, - in a single phenomenon .\n\nNoogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book \"The Phenomenon of Man\" by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, an anthropologist and philosopher, in a few places:\n\nThe lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book, including \"the contemporary period of evolution on Earth, signified by transformation of biosphere onto the sphere of intelligence—noosphere\", \"evolution run by human mind\" etc.\nThe most widespread interpretation is thought to be \"the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, biogenesis and anthropogenesis, forming a new sphere on Earth—noosphere\".\n\nIn 2005 Alexey Eryomin in the monograph Noogenesis and Theory of Intellect proposed a new concept of noogenesis in understanding the evolution of intellectual systems, concepts of intellectual systems, information logistics, information speed, intellectual energy, intellectual potential, consolidated into a theory of the intellect which combines the biophysical parameters of intellectual energy—the amount of information, its acceleration (frequency, speed) and the distance it's being sent—into a formula.\nAccording the new concept—proposed hypothesis continue prognostic progressive evolution of the species \"Homo sapiens\", the analogy between the human brain with the enormous amount of neural cells firing at the same time and a similarly functioning human society.\nA new understanding of the term \"noogenesis\" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on recapitulation theory links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.\nAll of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of \"live RAM\" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system. His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.\n\nTherefore, generalizing and summarizing: \nThe term \"noogenesis\" can be used in a variety of fields i.e. medicine, biophysics, semiotics, mathematics, information technology, psychology etc. thus making it a truly cross-disciplinary one. In astrobiology noogenesis concerns the origin of intelligent life and more specifically technological civilizations capable of communicating with humans and or traveling to Earth. The lack of evidence for the existence of such extraterrestrial life creates the Fermi paradox.\n\nThe emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of emergent evolution. \nTo understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.\nThe knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:\n\n\nSeveral published works which do not employ the term \"noogenesis\", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: working memory capacity ≥ 7, ability to predict, prognosis, hierarchical (6 layers neurons) system of information analysis, consciousness, memory, generated and consumed information properties etc. They also set the limits of several physiological aspects of human intelligence. Сonception of emergence of insight.\n\nHistorical evolutionary development and emergence of \"H. sapiens\" as species, include emergence of such concepts as anthropogenesis, phylogenesis, morphogenesis, cephalization, systemogenesis, cognition systems autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, development of an individual's intellect deals with concepts of embryogenesis, ontogenesis, morphogenesis, neurogenesis, higher nervous function of I.P.Pavlov and his philosophy of mind.\nDespite the fact that the morphofunctional maturity is usually reached by the age of 13, the definitive functioning of the brain structures is not complete until about 16–17 years of age.\n\nBioinformatics, genetic engineering, noopharmacology, cognitive load, brain stimulation, the efficient use of altered states of consciousness, use of non-human cognition, information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI) are all believed to be effective methods of intelligence advancement.\n\nThe development of the human brain, perception, cognition, memory and neuroplasticity are unsolved problems in neuroscience. Several megaprojects are being carried out in the American BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project in attempt to better our understanding of the brain's functionality along with the intention to develop human cognitive performance in the future with artificial intelligence, informational, communication and cognitive technology.\n","id":"2681589","title":"Noogenesis"}]
