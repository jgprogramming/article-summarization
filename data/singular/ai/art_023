Non-military UAVs have often been reported as causing hazards to aircraft, or to people or property on the ground.\n\n\nThe pilot of British Airways flight BA727 reported a collision with a UAV to Metropolitan Police. The Airbus A320 was approaching Heathrow Airport when the collision happened. None of the 132 passengers or 5 crew were injured. After an inspection by engineers, the aircraft was cleared to take off for its next flight.\n\nMembers of the British government as well as the Labour Party and BALPA called for urgent action, including a register of drone users and geo-fencing of airports.\n\nIn late April 2016 Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that experts believed that the incident was not related to UAVs. There was no damage to the aircraft and it wasn't clear if it was a plastic bag rather than a UAV. An investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch had been closed due to lack of evidence. Police had searched a \"wide area\" of Richmond and found nothing.\n\nA UAV collided with a Black Hawk helicopter in the evening over the eastern shore of Staten Island. The helicopter was one of two with the 82nd Airborne Division flying out of Fort Bragg on duty for the United Nations General Assembly. The helicopters were able to continue flying and landed at Linden Airport. Nobody was hurt, but part of the UAV was found at the bottom of the main rotor system.\n\nIn December 2017 the National Transportation Safety Board issued an accident report into the collision, finding the pilot of the UAV at fault. The UAV operator deliberately flew the UAV 2.5 miles away from himsef and was unaware of the helicopters' presence. The operator did not know of the collision until contacted by the NTSB and when interviewed by them showed only a general cursory awareness of the regulations. There was also a Temporary flight restriction in place, which allowed the Black Hawk but not the UAV. UAVs are prohibited from flying beyond line of sight under FAA regulations. \n\nA Beech King Air A100 of Skyjet Aviation collided with a UAV as the former was approaching Jean Lesage Airport near Quebec City. The aircraft landed safely despite being hit on the wing. Thei aircraft had flown from Rouyn-Noranda Airport to Rouyn-Noranda Airport with six passengers and two crew. A spokeswoman for Quebec City Police said that neither the UAV or operator had been found. It had been flying at 1500 feet - five times the maximum altitude that UAVs are permitted to fly in Canada. Regulations banning flying of UAVs near airports had been introduced earlier in 2017. Minister of Transport Marc Garneau released a statement saying \"Although the vast majority of drone operators fly responsibly, it was our concern for incidents like this that prompted me to take action and issue interim safety measures restricting where recreational drones could be flown. I would like to remind drone operators that endangering the safety of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and a serious offence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2017 a 23 year old UAV operator from Xiaoshan was detained because of footage taken from a drone flying near airliners descending to land at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport. The incident came to light when footage was uploaded to QQ. This was an eight-second clip from a ten-minute recording taken from an altitude of 450m. The operator had flown it to photograph a sunset, but had also recorded several airliners flying past. The model used was a DJI Mavic and the manufacturer strongly condemned the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUAVs have historically had a much higher loss rate than manned military aircraft. In addition to anti-aircraft weapons, UAVs are vulnerable to power and communications link losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"49321811","title":"UAV-related events"}]
