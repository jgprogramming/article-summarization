[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53815584","text":"Dash Robotics, Inc\n\nDash Robotics, Inc. is a toy robotics startup company located in Hayward, California. Their main focus is on prototyping and manufacturing smart toys (sometimes called \"connected toys\"). The company is often referred to simply as \"Dash,\" and was founded in 2013. Although not officially affiliated with UC Berkeley, many of the company's members met there.\n\nThey are most widely known for creating Kamigami Robots, a biomimetic, foldable robot that was funded via Kickstarter in 2015. Kamigami received attention for their unique motion, which mimics that of a cockroach. The original concepts behind the robot's motion are attributed to Dr. Robert Full, a biologist at UC Berkeley, and can be seen outlined in his Ted Talk. Mattel licensed the Kamigami brand in spring of 2017, and says it will oversee a new release in Fall of 2017.\n\nPrevious products include Dash Beta and Dash VR. Dash Beta was a cardboard, app-controlled robot that required glue to be assembled, and acted as a predecessor to Kamigami. Dash Beta is no longer in production.\n\nMr. Dad Seal of Approval\n\nMaker Faire Editor's Choice\n\n","id":"53815584","title":"Dash Robotics, Inc"}]
