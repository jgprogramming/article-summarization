[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9054429","text":"Autoassociative memory\n\nAutoassociative memory, also known as auto-association memory or an autoassociation network, is any type of memory that enables one to retrieve a piece of data from only a tiny sample of itself. It is often misunderstood to be only a form of backpropagation or other neural networks.\n\nTraditional memory stores data at a unique address and can \"recall\" the data upon presentation of the complete unique address.\n\nAutoassociative memories are capable of retrieving a piece of data upon presentation of only partial information from \"that\" piece of data.\n\nFor example, the sentence fragments presented below are sufficient for most humans to recall the missing information.\n\n\nMany readers will realize the missing information is in fact:\n\n\nThis demonstrates the capability of autoassociative networks to recall the whole by using some of its parts.\n\nHeteroassociative memories, on the other hand, can recall an associated piece of datum from \"one\" category upon presentation of data from \"another\" category. Hopfield networks have been shown to act as autoassociative memory since they are capable of remembering data by observing a portion of that data.\n\nBidirectional associative memories (BAM) are artificial neural networks that have long been used for performing heteroassociative recall.\n\n","id":"9054429","title":"Autoassociative memory"}]
