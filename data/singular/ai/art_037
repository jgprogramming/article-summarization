Computing collision-free paths, addressing clearance, and designing dynamic representations and re-planning strategies are examples of important problems with roots in computational geometry and discrete artificial intelligence search methods, and which are being re-visited with innovative new perspectives from researchers in computer graphics and animation.\n","id":"51775967","title":"Real-time path planning"}]
