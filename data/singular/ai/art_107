The layout of food pellets in the Santa Fe Trail problem has become a standard for comparing different genetic programming algorithms and solutions.\n\nOne method for programming and testing algorithms on the Santa Fe Trail problem is by using the NetLogo application. There is at least one case of a student creating a Lego robotic ant to solve the problem.\n\n\n","id":"31726662","title":"Santa Fe Trail problem"}]
