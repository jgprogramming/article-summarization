[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25455946","text":"FreeHAL\n\nFreeHAL is a distributed computing project to build a self-learning chatbot. This project is no longer active.\n\nFirst, the program was called \"JEliza\" referring to the chatbot ELIZA by Joseph Weizenbaum.\nThe \"J\" stood for Java because JEliza has first been programmed in Java. In May 2008, the program has been renamed to \"FreeHAL\" because the programming language has changed. Since that time the name is related to the computer in the film \"\".\n\nFreeHAL uses a semantic network and technologies like pattern recognition, stemming, part of speech databases and Hidden Markov Models in order to imitate a human behaviour.\nFreeHAL learns autonomously. While communicating by keyboard the program extends its database.\nCurrently, English and German are supported.\n\nBy using the BOINC infrastructure, new semantic networks for the program are built. FreeHAL@home appears to have terminated operations.\n\nIn 2008, the program won the first prize in the category \"Most Popular\" at the Chatterbox Challenge, a yearly competition between different similar chatbots.\n\nThere was an article about FreeHAL in the \"Linux Magazine\", Issue 97 from December 2008. In the German magazine \"com!\", the program was on the CD/DVD and in the list of the Top-10-Open-Source programs of the month.\n\n","id":"25455946","title":"FreeHAL"}]
