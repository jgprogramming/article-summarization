Together the four research objectives form the Centre’s research themes, which serve as organisational groupings of the Centre’s research projects.\n\nWill develop new sensing technologies and robust algorithms that allow robots to use visual perception in all viewing conditions: night and day, rain or shine, summer or winter, fast moving or static.\n\nWill create new theory and methods for using image data for control of robotic systems that navigate through space, grasp objects, interact with humans and use motion to assist in seeing.\n\nWill produce novel learning algorithms that can both detect and recognise a large, and potentially ever increasing, number of object classes from robotically acquired images, with increasing reliability over time.\n\nWill create novel technologies and techniques to ensure that the algorithms developed across the themes can be run in real-time on robotic systems deployed in large-scale real-world applications.\n","id":"49803819","title":"Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision"}]
