[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50835878","text":"Sensing floor\n\nA sensing floor is a floor with embedded sensors. \nDepending on their construction, these floors are either monobloc (e.g. structures made of a single frame, carpets).\nor modular (e.g. tiled floors, floors made of stripes of sensors). \nThe first sensing floor prototypes were developed in the 1990s, mainly for human gait analysis. \nSuch floors are usually used as a source of sensing information for an ambient intelligence.\nDepending on the type of sensors employed, sensing floors can measure load (pressure), proximity (to detect, track, and recognize humans), as well as the magnetic field (for detecting metallic objects like robots using magnetometers).\n\nSensing floors have a variety of usages:\n\nMore than 30 distinct sensing floor prototypes have been developed between 1990 and 2015.\nNotable examples of sensing floors have been developed by Oracle, MIT, and Inria \nAs of 2015, few sensing floors are available as commercial products, mainly targeting healthcare facilities (e.g. the GAITRite surface pressure sensing floor, and the SensFloor ).\n","id":"50835878","title":"Sensing floor"}]
