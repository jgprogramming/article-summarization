A further trial, with a four seat vehicle developed from the LUTZ, commenced along a guided busway near Cambridge for possible use in an after hours service.\n\nThe pod is a two-seater electric car with space for luggage. It has a limited top speed of and has a range of or can run for eight hours. The self-driving equipment includes 19 sensors, cameras, radar and Lidar. Users can hail them by using a smartphone app.\n\nThe autonomous control software is developed by Mobile Robotics Group from University of Oxford.\n\nThe Lutz Pathfinder pod has been developed by the UK Automotive Council, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and RDM Group.\n\nThe first trial of autonomous operation on a public road, with pedestrians, cycles and other vehicles, was conducted in Milton Keynes on 11 October 2016. The vehicles \"operated as expected.\"\n\nIn October 2017 a trial service, using a four-seat vehicle, between Trumpington Park and Ride and Cambridge railway station along the guided busway, for possible use in an after hours service. The Â£250,000 project was part funded by Innovate UK and delivered in partnership with Connecting Cambridgeshire and the Smart Cambridge Programme. If the trial is successful a ten seat vehicle will be used in routine service.\n\n","id":"45370555","title":"LUTZ Pathfinder"}]
