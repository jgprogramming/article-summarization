[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17290783","text":"Bidirectional associative memory\n\nBidirectional associative memory (BAM) is a type of recurrent neural network. BAM was introduced by Bart Kosko in 1988. There are two types of associative memory, auto-associative and hetero-associative. BAM is hetero-associative, meaning given a pattern it can return another pattern which is potentially of a different size. It is similar to the Hopfield network in that they are both forms of associative memory. However, Hopfield nets return patterns of the same size.\n\nA BAM contains two layers of neurons, which we shall denote X and Y. Layers X and Y are fully connected to each other. Once the weights have been established, input into layer X presents the pattern in layer Y, and vice versa.\n\nImagine we wish to store two associations, A1:B1 and A2:B2.\n\nThese are then transformed into the bipolar forms:\n\nFrom there, we calculate formula_1 where formula_2 denotes the transpose.\nSo,\n\nformula_3\n\nTo retrieve the association A1, we multiply it by M to get (4, 2, -2, -4), which, when run through a threshold, yields (1, 1, 0, 0), which is B1.\nTo find the reverse association, multiply this by the transpose of M.\n\nThe internal matrix has n x p independent degrees of freedom, where n is the dimension of the first vector (6 in this example) and p is the dimension of the second vector (4). This allows the BAM to be able to reliably store and recall a total of up to min(n,p) independent vector pairs, or min(6,4) = 4 in this example. The capacity can be increased above 4 if one gives up reliability and is willing to accept incorrect bits on the output.\n\n\n","id":"17290783","title":"Bidirectional associative memory"}]
