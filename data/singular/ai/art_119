[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4231161","text":"ALOPEX\n\nALOPEX (an acronym from \"\"ALgorithms Of Pattern EXtraction\"\") is a correlation based machine learning algorithm first proposed by Tzanakou and Harth in 1974.\n\nIn machine learning, the goal is to train a system to minimize a cost function or (referring to ALOPEX) a response function. Many training algorithms, such as backpropagation, have an inherent susceptibility to getting \"stuck\" in local minima or maxima of the response function. ALOPEX uses a cross-correlation of differences and a stochastic process to overcome this in an attempt to reach the absolute minimum (or maximum) of the response function.\n\nALOPEX, in its simplest form is defined by an updating equation:\n\nformula_1 \n\nWhere:\n\nEssentially, ALOPEX changes each system variable formula_15 based on a product of: the previous change in the variable formula_16formula_17, the resulting change in the cost function formula_16formula_19, and the learning rate parameter formula_9. Further, to find the absolute minimum (or maximum), the stochastic process formula_21 (Gaussian or other) is added to stochastically \"push\" the algorithm out of any local minima.\n\n","id":"4231161","title":"ALOPEX"}]
