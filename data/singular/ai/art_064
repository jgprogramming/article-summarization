It was developed as a \"Persona-Bot\" by Triumph PC Online, based in Washington, D.C.Â  Triumph PC's \"Persona-Bots\" are software programs that attempt to mimic the personalities or quirks of particular historical figures in conversation.\n\nIn development since 1997, the JLAI Project (originally called the Plastic Digital Karma Project) claims to have achieved similarity to Lennon's speech patterns, but still has a way to go to achieve the seamlessness of a conversation with a real person.\n\n\n","id":"8703613","title":"John Lennon Artificial Intelligence Project"}]
