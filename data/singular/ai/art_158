[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827635","text":"Learning vector quantization\n\nIn computer science, learning vector quantization (LVQ), is a prototype-based supervised classification algorithm. LVQ is the supervised counterpart of vector quantization systems.\n\nLVQ can be understood as a special case of an artificial neural network, more precisely, it applies a winner-take-all Hebbian learning-based approach. It is a precursor to self-organizing maps (SOM) and related to neural gas, and to the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). LVQ was invented by Teuvo Kohonen.\n\nAn LVQ system is represented by prototypes formula_1 which are defined in the feature space of observed data. In winner-take-all training algorithms one determines, for each data point, the prototype which is closest to the input according to a given distance measure. The position of this so-called winner prototype is then adapted, i.e. the winner is moved closer if it correctly classifies the data point or moved away if it classifies the data point incorrectly.\n\nAn advantage of LVQ is that it creates prototypes that are easy to interpret for experts in the respective application domain.\nLVQ systems can be applied to multi-class classification problems in a natural way. \nIt is used in a variety of practical applications. See http://liinwww.ira.uka.de/bibliography/Neural/SOM.LVQ.html\nfor an extensive bibliography.\n\nA key issue in LVQ is the choice of an appropriate measure of distance or similarity for training and classification. Recently, techniques have been developed which adapt a parameterized distance measure in the course of training the system, see e.g. (Schneider, Biehl, and Hammer, 2009) and references therein.\n\nLVQ can be a source of great help in classifying text documents.\n\nBelow follows an informal description.<br>\nThe algorithm consists of 3 basic steps. The algorithm's input is:\n\nThe algorithm's flow is:\n\nNote: formula_3 and formula_9 are vectors in feature space.<br>\nA more formal description can be found here: http://jsalatas.ictpro.gr/implementation-of-competitive-learning-networks-for-weka/\n\n\n","id":"827635","title":"Learning vector quantization"}]
