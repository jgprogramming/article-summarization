[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21573718","text":"HyperNEAT\n\nHypercube-based NEAT, or HyperNEAT, is a generative encoding that evolves artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the principles of the widely used NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. It is a novel technique for evolving large-scale neural networks using the geometric regularities of the task domain. It uses Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), which are used to generate the images for Picbreeder.org and shapes for EndlessForms.com. HyperNEAT has recently been extended to also evolve plastic ANNs and to evolve the location of every neuron in the network.\n\n\n","id":"21573718","title":"HyperNEAT"}]
