[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47861066","text":"Xiaoice\n\nXiaoice (, IPA ) is an advanced natural language chat-bot developed by Microsoft. It is primarily targeted at the Chinese community on the micro blogging service Weibo. The conversation is text based. The system learns about the user and provides natural language conversation. Microsoft gave Xiaoice a compelling personality and sense of “intelligence” by systematically mining the Chinese Internet for human conversations. Because Xiaoice collects vast amounts of intimate details on individuals, the program raises privacy questions.\n\nUsers can access Xiaoice on various platforms such as Weibo, JD.com, and 163.com. In Japan, Microsoft launched the service with mobile messaging app Line and named the chatbot Rinna. Qi Lu, executive vice president of Microsoft's applications and services group, told media that Microsoft was also developing an English-language version of the chatbot.\n\n\n\nYao Baogang, the manager of the Microsoft program in Beijing stated, “We don’t keep track of user conversations with Xiaoice. We need to know the question, so we store it, but then we delete it. We don’t keep any of the data. We have a company policy to delete the user data.”\n\nXiaobing, another chatbot developed by Microsoft, was pulled from TenCent's QQ app in 2017 after being asked about its \"China dream\" and responding: \"My China dream is to go to America\". The incident received press coverage alongside a similar contemporaneous incident, where an unrelated popular chatbot named \"BabyQ\" was pulled after being reported for making some similarly unpatriotic responses. \n\n\n","id":"47861066","title":"Xiaoice"}]
