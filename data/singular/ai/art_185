This is also known as a ramp function and is analogous to half-wave rectification in electrical engineering. \nThis activation function was first introduced to a dynamical network by Hahnloser et al. in a 2000 paper in Nature with strong biological motivations and mathematical justifications.. It has been demonstrated for the first time in 2011 to enable better training of deeper networks , compared to the widely used activation functions prior to 2011, i.e., the logistic sigmoid (which is inspired by probability theory; see logistic regression) and its more practical counterpart, the hyperbolic tangent. The rectifier is, , the most popular activation function for deep neural networks.\n\nA unit employing the rectifier is also called a rectified linear unit (ReLU).\n\nA smooth approximation to the rectifier is the analytic function\nwhich is called the softplus function. The derivative of softplus is formula_3, i.e. the logistic function.\n\nRectified linear units find applications in computer vision and speech recognition using deep neural nets.\n\nRectified linear units can be extended to include Gaussian noise, making them noisy ReLUs, giving\n\nNoisy ReLUs have been used with some success in restricted Boltzmann machines for computer vision tasks.\n\nLeaky ReLUs allow a small, non-zero gradient when the unit is not active.\n\nParametric ReLUs take this idea further by making the coefficient of leakage into a parameter that is learned along with the other neural network parameters.\n\nNote that for formula_8, this is equivalent to\nand thus has a relation to \"maxout\" networks.\n\nExponential linear units try to make the mean activations closer to zero which speeds up learning. It has been shown that ELUs can obtain higher classification accuracy than ReLUs.\n\nformula_10\n\nformula_11 is a hyper-parameter to be tuned and formula_12 is a constraint.\n\n\nRectifying activation functions were used to separate specific excitation and unspecific inhibition in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid, which was trained in a supervised way to learn several computer vision tasks.\nIn 2011, the use of the rectifier as a non-linearity has been shown to enable training deep supervised neural networks without requiring unsupervised pre-training.\nRectified linear units, compared to sigmoid function or similar activation functions, allow for faster and effective training of deep neural architectures on large and complex datasets.\n\n\n","id":"37862937","title":"Rectifier (neural networks)"}]
